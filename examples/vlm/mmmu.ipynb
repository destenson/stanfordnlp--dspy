      "The total change in the M1 Money Supply is the sum of the deposits and the change in reserves. The change in reserves is the amount of deposits minus the required reserves. The required reserves are calculated as 10% of the deposits. Therefore, the change in reserves is $700 - (0.10 * $700) = $630. The total change in the M1 Money Supply is $700 + $630 = $1330.

      "To calculate the rate of return for the second period, we use the formula: Rate of return = (Ending value - Beginning value) / Beginning value. For Stock C, the beginning value is $100 and the ending value is $55. Plugging these values into the formula gives us: Rate of return = (55 - 100) / 100 = -45%. However, since the question asks for the rate of return, we take the absolute value of the result, which is 45%. This is not one of the answer choices, so we need to convert it to a percentage. 45% is equivalent to 0.45, so the rate of return is 0.45.

This is a conditional probability problem. We can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the uniform distribution to find this probability.
